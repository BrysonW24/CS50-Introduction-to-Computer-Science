ORIGINAL CODE:

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, %s\n", get_string("What's your name? "));
}
// Iteration 1: printf("hello, world\n");
// Iteration 2: string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
// Interation 3: printf("hello, %s\n", name);


Hints

Don’t recall how to prompt the user for their name?
Recall that you can use get_string as follows, storing its return value in a variable called name of type string.

stringname=get_string("What's your name? ");

Don’t recall how to format a string?
Don’t recall how to join (i.e., concatenate) the user’s name with a greeting? Recall that you can use printf not only to print but to format a string (hence, the f in printf), a la the below, wherein name is a string.

printf("hello, %s\n",name);

Use of undeclared identifier?
Seeing the below, perhaps atop other errors?

error: use of undeclared identifier 'string'; did you mean 'stdin'?

Recall that, to use get_string, you need to include cs50.h (in which get_string is declared) atop a file, as with:

#include<cs50.h>

How to Test Your Code
Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using check50, a command-line program that will output happy faces whenever your code passes CS50’s automated tests and sad faces whenever it doesn’t! But be sure to compile and test it yourself as well!
